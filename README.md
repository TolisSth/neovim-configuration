Yet another neovim configuration

### Shortcuts
I didn't write a lot of shortcuts, I only wrote the following:

- <leader>fg: Live grep (telescope)
- <leader>fb: Find in buffer (telescope)
- <leader>fh: Help (telescope)
- C - h: Open NvimTree (NvimTree)

### Requirements
- Rust analyzer
- ripgrep 
- fd

### Motivation
I am sick and tired of modern code editors and their horrible performance, if I wanted to benchmark my computer I would use a benchmark not a code editor. Also watch up with all the extra feautures, can't I just choose what I need? That's why I love neovim and vim, they are simple yet effective, of course when you start handling larger code bases you understand that they are not enough, well that's why I started writing this config.
